## Introduction

The Rocker project was launched in October 2014 as a collaboration between CB & DE to provide high-quality
Docker images containing the R environment \citep{edd2014}. Since that time, the project has seen both 
considerable uptake in the community and substantial development and evolution. Here we seek to document
the project's objectives and uses.

### What is Docker? 

Docker is a popular open source tool to create, distribute, deploy, and run software applications using
*containers*.  Containers provide a virtual environment requiring everything an application needs to run:
code, runtime, system tools, system runtime.  Docker containers are lightweight (sharing the operating system kernel,
starting instantly, using a layered filesystem to minimize disk footprint and download time), built on open standards
that run on all major platforms (Linux, Mac, Windows) and provide an added layer of security by running an
application in an isolated environment \citep{what-docker}.  




## Rocker organization and workflow

The Rocker Project consists of a suite of images built automatically by and hosted on the Docker Hub, <https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker>.  Source Dockerfiles, supporting scripts and documentation are hosted on GitHub.  The issues tracker and pull requests are used to provide community input, disucssions and contributions to these images. The rocker project wiki <https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker/wiki> provides a place to synthesize community-contributed documentation, use-cases, and other knowledge about using the Rocker images.


- GitHub, Docker Hub (Docker Cloud)

 Automated builds on Docker Hub help ensure the integrity of the build process and ensure that the image build corresponds exactly to Dockerfile on GitHub.


### Images in the Rocker Project

The Rocker Project aims to provide a small core if Docker images that serve both as convenient base images for a wide range of possible applications while still providing a 'batteries included' approach of images that can be used out of the box.  The challenges of balancing diverse needs driven by very different use cases (discussed in more detail below) against the overarching goals of creating images that are not sufficiently light-weight, easy to use and easy to maintain is a difficult art.  The implementation in both individual Rocker images and image stacks can never perfect that balance for everyone, but today reflects the considerable community input and testing over past few years.  

<!--What is a Dockerfile? How do they stack? -->



<!-- some overview on using vs extending images (i.e. writing derivative Dockerfiles). -->



The Rocker Project can be largely divided into two stacks which address different needs.  The first stack is based on `debian:testing`, the second, more recently introduced stack is based only on `debian` stable releases.  These stacks have different aims and thus provide different images, as shown in Tables 1 & 2.

The Debian platform provides a small base image, the well known `apt` package management system and rich ecosystem of software libraries, making it the base image of choice for Docker images, including many of the "official" images maintained by Docker's own development team.  The Debian platform is also perhaps the best supported Linux platform within the R community, including an active `r-sig-debian` listserve.  Unfortunately, the relatively long period between stable Debian releases (roughly two years recently) means that software in the `debian:stable` releases can lag significantly behind current releases. This issue is the primary motivation behind the `debian:testing` stack.

The Debian release cycle follows three stages: `unstable`, `testing`, and `stable`. 

## The debian:testing base

The `debian:testing` stack aims to makes the most efficient use of upstream builds -- the precompiled `.deb` binaries provided by the Debian repositories.  It is both quicker and easier to install software from binaries, since the package manager (`apt`) manages the necessary dependencies and it bypasses the time-consuming process of compiling from source.  Basing this stack on `debian:testing` means that much more recent versions of commonly used libraries and compilers are available as binaries than would be found in a Debian stable release.  In order to provide access to the most recent avialble binaries, this stack uses apt-pinning [@apt-pinning] to allow the `apt` package manager to also install binaries from `debian:unstable`, which represents the most recent, bleeding edge of packages built for Debian when necessary.  For instance, the `r-base` image provided by Rocker installs the most recent version of R as a binary from Debian `unstable`.  Similarly, recent versions of many popular R packages can also be installed through the package manager, e.g. `apt-get install r-cran-XML`.  This can be particularly helpful for packages with external system dependencies (such as `libxml2-dev` in this example) which cannot be installed from the R console.  

As the names `testing` and `unstable` imply, this approach is not without a downside.  The particular version of any given package can change as packages move from `unstable` into `testing` and newer versions are sent to `unstable` during the normal course of Debian development.  This can occassionally break an previously working installation command in a Dockerfile until the maintainer redirects the package manager to install a the package from the `unstable` sources that could previously be installed from `testing`, or vice versa (using the `-t` option in `apt`, see Box 1 on apt-pinning.)  

The `debian:testing` stack thus offers the following advantages: 

1. These Dockerfiles are easy to develop and extend because almost all software can be installed through the package manager
2. These Dockerfiles always install the most recent available software
3. These Dockerfiles can almost always build relatively quickly

and these down-sides:

1. These Dockerfiles require occassional minor maintenance to ensure successful builds
2. The resulting images are inherently dynamic: rebuilding the same Dockerfile months or years apart will generate images with significantly different versions of software installed.
3. The use of apt pinning may be unfamiliar to some users.
4. `testing` and `unstable` do not recieve the same attention to security updates.

### debian-stable base

This stack emphasizes stability and reproducibility of the Docker build.  The key feature of this stack is the ability to run older versions of R, along with the contemporaneous versions of R packages.  A user specifies the version desired using an image tag, e.g. 
`rocker/r-ver:3.3.1` will refer to an image with R version 3.3.1 installed.  Omitting the tag is equivalent to using the tag `latest`, which, as the name implies, will always point to an image using the current R release.  Thus, users wanting to create downstream Dockerfiles which are based on the current release at time but will continue to reconstruct the same environment in the future after newer R versions are released should explicilty include the corresponding version tag, e.g. `rocker/r-ver:3.4.0` at the time of writing, and not the `latest` tag.  Users can also run the current development version of R using the tag `devel`, which is built nightly from R-devel sources from `subversion`.

**MRAN archives**: To facilitate installation of only contemporaneous versions of R packages on these images, the default CRAN mirror from which to install R packages is fixed to a snapshot of CRAN corresponding to the last date for which that version of R was the latest release. These snapshots are provided by the MRAN archive created by Revolution Analytics (now aquired by Microsoft), which archives daily snapshots of all of CRAN, from which a user can install packages with the usual `install.packages()` function  [@MRAN]. Users can always override this default by passing any current CRAN repository explicitly.  Unlike CRAN, Bioconductor only updates its repositories through bi-annual releases aligned to R's Spring release schedule, Bioconductor packages be installed in the usual way using `bioclite`, which automatically selects the Bioconductor release corresponding to the version of R in use.   

**Version tags**:  These version tags are propegated throughout this stack: for instance, `rocker/tidyverse:devel` will provide the currently released versions of the R packages in the `tidyverse` [@tidyverse] installed on the nightly build of R-devel.  Developers building packages on this stack are encouraged to tag their images accordingly as well.  Table 3 indicates which versions of R are currently available in the stack, going back to `3.1.0`.  While older versions may be added to the stack at a later date, we note that the MRAN snapshots began in starting 2014-09-17 and thus go back only to R `3.1` era.  Each tag must be built from a separate Dockerfile, enabling minor differences in the build instructions to accomidate changing dependencies.  Dockerfiles for past versions (e.g. < `3.4.0` currently) are intended to remain static over the long term, while the tag for the current version, `latest`, and `devel` may be tweaked to accomidate new features or dependencies.  


In this stack, the desired version of R is always built directly from source rather than the `apt` repositories.  Compilers and dependencies are still installed from the stable `apt` repositories, and thus lag behind the more recent versions found in the `testing` stack. Version tags `3.3.3` and older are based on the Debian 8.0 release, codenamed `jessie`, while `3.4.0`, `devel`, and `latest` are based on Debian 9.0, `stretch`, released 2017-06-17, and thus have access to much newer versions of common system dependencies and compilers.  Dependencies needed to compile R that are not required at runtime are removed once R is installed, keeping the base images light-weight for faster download times.  While most system dependencies required by common R packages can still be installed from the `apt` repositories, occassionally a more recent version must be compiled from source (e.g. the Gibbs Sampling library, JAGS, and the geospatial toolkit GDAL, must both be compiled from source on `debian:jessie` images).  In this stack, users should never install R packages, using `apt`, since this will install a second, older version of R from the Debian repositories and a dated version of the R package (since any `r-cran-pkgname` package in the Debian repositories will depend on `r-base` in `apt` as well).  


**Build schedule**: All images are built automatically from their corresponding Dockerfiles (found in the GitHub repositories `rocker-org/rocker-versioned` and `rocker-org/geospatial`). A `cron` job sends nightly build triggers to Docker Hub to rebuild the `latest` and `devel` tagged images throughout the stack.  To decrease load on the hub, build triggers for the numeric version tags are sent monthly. Allthough the Dockerfiles for older R versions installs an almost-identical software environment every time, the monthly rebuilding of these images on Docker Hub ensures they continue to recieve Debian security updates from upstream, and proves the build recipe still executes successfully.   Note that rebuilding images with software from external repositories never produces a bitwise identical image, and thus the image identifier hash will change at each build.

Customizing builds: `--build-arg` options in `r-ver`: `R_VERSION`, `BUILD_DATE`. in `rstudio`: `RSTUDIO_VERSION`, `PANDOC_TEMPLATES_VERSION`.  
Docker metadata labels: <http://schema-label.org> metadata for `license`, `vcs-url` (GitHub repository), and `vendor`.  These can be altered or extended in downstream images. 








## Maintenance and Updates

These images are actively maintained.  This means that while an effort is made to preserve the general function of these images over time, both these Dockerfiles and the resulting images are subject to some change over time.  In particular:

- Images are regularly re-built on Docker Hub whenever their base image changes, starting with changes to `debian` Docker image.  This is the rough equivalent of running `apt-get upgrade` on `debian`, since all `apt-get` commands are re-run and will pull in the most current sources.  This allows the images to receive security updates to any packages installed from the `debian` repositories, but will not in general change the versions of any software and is very unlikely to break anything.

- The Dockerfiles themselves are subject to change, to improve performance, ease of use, readability, or other concerns raised in the issues.  These changes should also not alter the general behavior of R or R packages on the image.  These changes can be seen in the git history.  The [rocker-versioned](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned) repo will use its own semantic version tagging to indicate changes to this repository, with snapshots from these tags archived on Zenodo.

# Use cases


There are several different but complementary reasons for creating the containerized R environments provided by
the Rocker project, including convenience, community input, portability and scaling, reproducibility, and instruction. 
We describe these in turn before presenting the commands required to deploy these environments in different use cases.



### Portability & cloud computing

One of the most popular uses of the Rocker containers is to provide a fast and reliable mechanism to deploy an R envionment on a remote server, such as Amazon Web Services Elastic Compute (AWS EC2), DigitalOcean, NSF's Jetstream servers, or private or institutional server hardware.  Being able to test code in a predictable, pre-configured R environment on a local machine and then run the same code in an identical environment on a remote server (e.g. for access to greater RAM, more processors, or merely to free up the local machine from a long-running computation) is essential for low-friction scaling of analysis.  Without such contanerization, getting code to run appropriately in a remote environment can be a major undertaking, requiring both time and knowledge many would-be users may not have. 

The following code installs Docker on almost any Linux-based server and launches a Rocker container providing the RStudio-server environment over a web interface.

```
wget -qO- https://get.docker.com/ | sh
sudo docker run -d -p 80:8787 -e PASSWORD=<PICK-A-PASSWORD> rocker/rstudio
```

After running these two lines, the user may log into the server merely by pasting its IP address or DNS name into a browser and entering their password for user `rstudio`.  This provides the user with a familiar, interactive environment running on a remote machine while requiring a minimum of expertise (with many cloud providers, these two lines of code can be run in a startup script without ever logging into the server over ssh).  Some caveats and additional configuration options are discussed in the example section below.  The user can select a Rocker container which contains the required software pre-installed, such as `rocker/tidyverse`, which provides the popular `tidyverse` suite of R packages \citep{tidyverse}, or even use their own containers which can extend the Rocker containers, as discussed below.  This workflow saves considerable time relative to installing each package from scratch, which can take over an hour to reconstruct the environment provided by some rocker containers.  As many commericial cloud providers charge by the hour, a fast and simple mechanism to deploy the desired environment in the cloud is crucial to making this approach practical for more exploratory analyses.  

<!--
FIXME describe other modes of running containers, e.g. R terminal


-->

Unlike virtual machine images, multiple such Docker containers can be run on the same server in the same way (though unique TCP ports must be assigned to each if they are accessed through the RStudio web interface). More importantly, it is much easier to test software locally using the identical Docker container environment before deploying on a remote server than it is to run a virtual machine such as an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) locally, or to reproduce the runtime environment identically on local and server systems.

Rocker images may be used for quickly deploying R code on remote servers without the use of the RStudio interface, running R in terminal mode over an `ssh` connection. As with any interactive docker instance, users should specify the interactive (`-i`) and terminal (`-t`, here combined with interactive as `-ti`) flags, and specify the desired executable environment (e.g. `R`, though other common options may be `Rscript` or `bash`):   

```
docker run --rm -ti rocker/tidyverse R
```

This example shows the use of the `--rm` flag to indicate that the container should be removed when the interactive session is finished. 


Another illustration of this portability is with regard to Continuous Integration servers such as Travis <https://travis.com> or Circle-CI <https://circle-ci.com>.  While support for the R language on Travis has greatly improved recently (\citep{r-travis}), very customized environments can still be difficult to run (particularly for testing scripts not laid out in the R package structure).  


### Convenience

Installation of certain R packages can be challenging and non-intuitive, particularly when those packages require specific external dependencies. By running R through a Rocker image, users can deploy an R environment where their desired packages and libraries have already been installed and configured. As we discuss below, this configuration benefits from the input of a large community of users, helping to ensure better and more reliable performance. For instance, one example of such a configuration is in building and testing R packages using compiler sanatizers \citep{edd_sanitizers}, which requires R itself be re-compiled with specialized settings not avaialable or familiar to most R users.  Using the Rocker images `rocker/r-devel-san` and `rocker/r-devel-ubsan-clang` provides a fast and simple way for users to test 
   
Many users are reluctant to upgrade their suite of installed packages, which may break their existing code or even their R environment if the installation goes poorly.  However, upgrading packages and/or the R environment is often necessary to run analysis of a colleague or access more recent methods. Using Rocker, users can run the latest or specific earlier versions of R and R packages in an isolated environment without impacting their local system.  

### Extensible and Community-optimized images

Rocker images benefit from widespread use, testing and contributions from many members of the R community.
